# Playing about with Graphql

A simple Ruby Graphql API
Originally Built from this [tutorial](https://engineering.musefind.com/build-a-graphql-api-in-under-20-minutes-3cdaa774b786)

With added mutation and data load batching from the [Ruby Graphql Gems guide](http://graphql-ruby.org/guides)

To have a go run
```
bundle install
bundle exec rails server
```
Then go to `http://localhost:3000/graphiql`

The interesting code is under app/types
